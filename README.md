# AI-Smart contract integeration for Anomaly detection of Blockchain data
A simple blockchain that runs a smart contract is simulated. An Isolation Forest model is used to perform anomaly detection of the data(oracle.txt) used by the the simulated Smart contract.
\n(In a forthcoming research paper, more details on this are provided.)
